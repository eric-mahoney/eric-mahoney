## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Eric - I'm a Junior Software Developer looking for roles in Front End Development. I love working in teams and bringing designs to life. I have previous experience working with Angular, Django, Ionic, Firebase, and Bootstrap.

Currently, I am a Junior Software Engineer at [BrainEvolved](https://www.brainevolved.com/), a small healthcare startup in Northern Virginia. I work on the mobile app team creating features using Angular, Ionic, and Firebase. Previously, I worked at [George Mason University: Student Centers](https://studentcenters.gmu.edu/), where I was responsible for building them a website from the ground up with over 60 pages!

I'm currently working on learning React! You can view some of the projects I've built down below in my GitHub repos.

### Hobbies ðŸ“š

I love learning new things inside and outside of programming. Currently I'm learning: React, GSAP animations, how to juggle, and how to play the Ukulele.
