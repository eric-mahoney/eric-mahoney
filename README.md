## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Eric - I'm a Junior Software Developer looking for roles in Front End Development. I love working in teams and bringing designs to life. I have previous experience working with Angular, Django, Ionic, Firebase, and Bootstrap.

Currently, I am a Software Engineering Intern at [BrainEvolved](https://www.brainevolved.com/), a small healthcare startup in Northern Virginia. I work on the mobile app team creating features using Angular, Ionic, and Firebase. I also work at [George Mason University: Student Centers](https://studentcenters.gmu.edu/), where I am single-handedly overhauling the entire front end with a more modern and responsive design.

In my spare time, Iâ€™m currently working on [Warzone Roulette](https://warzoneroulette.web.app/), a community driven web-app focused on bringing new ideas and strategies to Call of Duty: Warzone.


### Hobbies ðŸ“š

I love learning new things inside and outside of programming. Currently I'm learning: GSAP animations, how to juggle, and how to play the Ukulele.
